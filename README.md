# MotoGP Clicky Game

First assignment using React at the Penn Coding Bootcamp

## How It Works

* Click the photo of any rider to start the game (and gain your first point)
* The photos will immediately be shuffled on the screen
* Now keep clicking more photos, making sure that you don't click the same photo twice
* If you click the same photo twice, you lose!
* If you click each of the nine riders once, you win!

## Under the Hood

Beside React and its components, the only external package used by this game is Sweet Alert for modals
